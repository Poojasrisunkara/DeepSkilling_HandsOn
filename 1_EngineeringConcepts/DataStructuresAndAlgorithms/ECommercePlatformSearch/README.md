##  1. Understanding Asymptotic Notation

Big O notation helps us describe how fast or slow an algorithm is as the input grows — it’s like a speed rating. 
For search operations:
- **Best case**: We find what we’re looking for right away. For example, the product we are looking for being there in the front aisle of a shop
- **Average case**: We find it somewhere in the middle. 
- **Worst case**: We find it at the end or not at all.

##  4. Analysis of Search Algorithms

Linear search checks every product one by one — simple, but slow for large lists.  
Binary search is much faster but only works if the list is already sorted.  
For a real e-commerce platform with thousands of products, Although we have to trade off the privilage of maintaining an unsorted list, binary search is better because it's quicker and more efficient.
