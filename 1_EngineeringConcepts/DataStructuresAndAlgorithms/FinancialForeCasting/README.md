### Skill 7 : Financial Forecasting


## 1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms

Recursion is a way of solving problems where a function calls itself to break down the task into smaller steps.  
It helps simplify problems like financial forecasting by working on one year at a time, and letting the function handle the rest recursively.  
Like solving a puzzle one piece at a time, letting each call handle a smaller chunk.


## 4. Analysis of Recursive Algorithm

This recursive function calculates the future amount by predicting it year by year.  
However, recursion can lead to repeated calculations and slow performance if not managed carefully.  
In this case, it's efficient because each year depends directly on the previous one â€” but for complex cases, using techniques like **memoization** or **iterative solutions** can help optimize it further and reduce unnecessary function calls.
